# vtcl.vtcl-8.6-quickfix
This is a quick-fix of Vtcl based on a version used by
Rildo Pragana  (Mar 9, 2010) who made vtcl working with
TCL/TK-8.5

It is _not_ a complete package as vtcl-1.6.1a1 provided it.
Vtcl-1.6.1a1 only works reliably up to TCL/TK-8.4 - although
it is said to work with TCL/TK-8.5.

I will provide a complete Vtcl-8.6 (without '-quickfix' in the
repository name, if I have integrated Rildo Praganas fixes to
the 'official' vtcl-1.6.1a1 code base.

It was tested with stock TCL/TK-8.6 on Fedora-23 and ActiveTcl-86.
